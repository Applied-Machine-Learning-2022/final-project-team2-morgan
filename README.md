## Description
<!--
Give a short description on what your project accomplishes and what tools is uses. In addition, you can drop screenshots directly into your README file to add them to your README. Take these from your presentations.
-->
Documents, handwritten letters, fine print, and even in photographs letters are everywhere. Furthermore theyâ€™re all in different fonts and sizes. This creates a very challenging task for us to analyze these physical letters and convert them into data. We did this by training a neural network to identify letters through OCR data files. The OCR data files contain letters that have been converted to binary classifications. In order to train this model we used the letters A to J and numbered them from 0 to 9. Then once the model is done we tested the accuracy and precision of the outcome.
